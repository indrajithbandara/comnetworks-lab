# Lab 3 - Simple Networks

All activitites should be done in [Packet Tracer](http://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/rl/info/resurse/packet-tracer).

1. Build a network between two computers and verify the two computers can ping each other.
2. Build a network between multiple computers. You should use at least two switches. Verify that a computer connected to a switch can ping a computer connected to another switch.
3. Download [course5.pkt](/course5.pkt) and open it. Add a switch to the home router and connect a computer to it. Make sure the computer can ping `8.8.8.8` and browse `google.com`.
4. Drag another PDA into the network and it will automatically connect to the WiFi router. Add a WPA2 password to the WiFi router. Finally, change the password on one of the PDAs. Now, you are connected to a secure network.

After you finish each of the problems, save your network as a `.pkt` file. In the end, upload it to [my Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/OeRVP30HmC2Tmt9qYsW0).
