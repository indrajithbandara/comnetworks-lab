# Course 5

I replaced the teacher for this course. You can get the slides [here][slides].

If you want to play with Packet Tracer, get it from our friends from [Poli][PT].

Finally, you can open [`course5.pkt`](/course5.pkt) from this repo to get the topology with an ISP router, DNS server, HTTP server, home router, computer and PDA.
